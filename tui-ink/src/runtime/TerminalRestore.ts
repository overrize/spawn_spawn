/**
 * TerminalRestore — terminal mode restore on exit.
 *
 * The TUI enables mouse tracking at runtime (wheel scrolling) and bracketed
 * paste. Both are terminal-global modes: if the process dies without turning
 * them off, the *parent shell* keeps receiving the reports. Symptom: every
 * wheel scroll dumps SGR sequences (`\x1b[<64;41;19M`) into the shell prompt.
 *
 * Why this needs a synchronous write
 * ----------------------------------
 * Node's process.stdout is asynchronous for TTYs **on Windows** (synchronous on
 * POSIX — see "A note on process I/O" in the Node docs). So a
 * `process.stdout.write()` issued from a `process.on("exit")` handler, or on the
 * line before `process.exit()`, is discarded before it reaches the terminal.
 * The restore silently did nothing on Windows while working fine on Linux/macOS.
 *
 * `fs.writeSync(1, ...)` bypasses the async stream and always flushes. It also
 * bypasses the stdout write shim in AgentRuntime, which is what we want:
 * control sequences must never be wrapped in synchronized-output markers.
